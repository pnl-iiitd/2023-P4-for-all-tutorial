# P4-for-all
This repository contains the material for the "P4 for all" tutorial conducted as part of the one-week workshop on "SDN: Software Defined Networking Architectures and Applications" at IIIT Kottayam. 

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate the importance of the P4 language in the SDN setup. P4 is the domain-specific language for writing networking programs. We discuss the applicability of the P4 language in writing networking programs for kernel-bypass stack (DPDK), kernel application (eBPF, XDP), smartNICs (NPU and FPGA), and programmable switches (Intel Tofino). We also discuss the limitations of the P4 language and how could we extend the language using custom externs using FPGA targets.
